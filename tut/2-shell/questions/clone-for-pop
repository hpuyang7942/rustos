Why does StackVec require T: Clone to pop()?   
    Because StackVec is actually still implemented on stack. For Vec that is implemented in heap, whatever got popped
    out would not be further affected by the operations done for the Vector. However, for StackVec, if the original
    object is return, its value could be affected by further operations on the StackVec since its address is still
    adjacent to the other objects that are still in the StackVec. Therefore, by implementing Clone trait, we allow
    the program to copy its value so that the popped object stand alone from the StackVec, it wonâ€™t be further effected
    by the operations done on the StackVec.
