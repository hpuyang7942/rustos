How are read-only and write-only accesses enforced?
    They disable write and read respectively by macros readable! and writable!: readable!
    only passes a sharable reference to the inner function, then it can only read instead of
    changing the value of it; writable passes a mutable reference to the inner function, it
    only has write function in its trait implementation, then it can only write, but not read.
