Why does push return a Result?
    Because StackVec is just imitating the way Stack works: we pre-allocate a certain amount of memory to the 
    program, instead really having infinity space for it to grow, the space is limited. Once the StackVec::push()
    uses up the space, we need Result as return type to tell us whether it is success or not.
