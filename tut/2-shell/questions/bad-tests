Why does the test.sh script always set -r?
    By setting -r, we always disable XMODEM protocol in test. Because this
    protocol is interactive, it requires one receiver and one sender, the
    receiver and sender needs each other’s information to perform next step.
    While here, we can only test by raw data because we don’t have a receiver.
